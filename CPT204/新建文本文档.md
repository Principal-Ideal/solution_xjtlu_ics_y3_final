## Short Answer Questions
- 1 . A primitive variable stores the actual values of primitive data types directly, while a reference variable stores the address of an object in memory.
- 2 . Method Overriding is a feature in Java where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by its parent class, whereas Method Overloading is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method having the same name, but with different parameter lists.
- 3 . false and false
- 4 . An interface is a class-like construct that contains only constants, abstract methods, default methods, and static methods. In many ways, an interface is similar to an abstract class, but an abstract class can contain instance variables.
- 5 . [New York, Dallas]
- 6 . 4.Arrays.sort(fruits);
- 7 . A generic class or method permits you to specify allowable types of objects that the class or method can work with. If you attempt to use a class or method with an incompatible object, the compiler will detect the error.
- 8 . public static <E> void print(E[] list)
- 9 . In Java collections, the ArrayList is efficient for retrieving elements and for adding and removing elements at the end of the list. On the other hand, a LinkedList is better suited for adding and removing elements at any position within the list, although locating specific elements for operations is not as efficient.
- 10 . green
- 11 . Stacks store objects that are processed in a last-in, first-out fashion. Queues store objects that are processed in a first-in, first-out fashion.
- 12 . 10 20 30 40 50 60
- 13 .  [ABC, FGH]
- 14 . Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>(); (or HashSet<Integer>()
- 15 . In a library management system where you need to frequently check the availability and information of books with unique identifiers (e.g., the book ID), the most suitable data structure to store the books in the library would be a HashMap (or Map).
- 16 . The Big O notation is a theoretical approach for analyzing the performance of an algorithm. It estimates how fast an algorithmâ€™s execution time increases as the input size increases, which enables you to compare two algorithms by examining their growth rates.
An algorithm with the O(n) time complexity is called a linear time algorithm and an algorithm with the O(log n) time complexity is called a logarithmic algorithm.
Use the Big O notation to estimate the time complexity of the following method: O(n)
The loop iterates m.length times. If n = m.length, the complexity is O(n).
The worst-case time complexity for selection sort, insertion sort, bubble sort, and quicksort algorithms is O(n^2).
Selection Sort: O(n^2)
Insertion Sort: O(n^2)
Bubble Sort: O(n^2)
Quick Sort: O(n^2) (e.g., when the array is already sorted and the pivot is always the smallest/largest element).
Suppose a list is [12, 9, 15, 4, 20, 11]. After the first pass of bubble sort, the list becomes [9, 12, 4, 15, 11, 20].
Initial: [12, 9, 15, 4, 20, 11]
Compare 12 and 9: Swap. [9, 12, 15, 4, 20, 11]
Compare 12 and 15: No swap. [9, 12, 15, 4, 20, 11]
Compare 15 and 4: Swap. [9, 12, 4, 15, 20, 11]
Compare 15 and 20: No swap. [9, 12, 4, 15, 20, 11]
Compare 20 and 11: Swap. [9, 12, 4, 15, 11, 20]
